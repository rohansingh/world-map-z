===========

World Map Z is an interactive world map that displays the nuclear strike range of known nuclear
states.

Still under development. The plan is to use world region data from [Natural Earth](http://naturalearthdata.com)
and range data from verifiable sources, compiled into TopoJSON files.

d3.js can then be used to render this geodata in a browser and add interactivity.
